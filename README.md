# ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE

Minimax algorithm is a backtracking or recursive algorithm used in decision making and game theory.

It is mostly used for game playing in Artificial Intelligence such as
                        -Chess
                        
                        -Go
                        
                        -Tic-tac-toe
                       
One of the challenges I faced while learning algorithm was going the game tree.

It had several levels that require traversing through to the terminal nodes  and backtracking to the intial node.

I hope to improve on the chess multiplayer project I am working on.
